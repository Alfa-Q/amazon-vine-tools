# Amazon Vine Tools
An electron application built with additional tools for Amazon Vine members.

<hr>

<h3>Current Features</h3>

* Additional attributes retrieved for Vine products.
* Search and filter Amazon Vine items.
* Bookmark Vine products.

<hr>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

* Pulling updated data from Amazon is restricted to once every 12 hours.
* During cooldown, the application will only used cached data from the last pull.
* Cannot request items through the app.  While this could be implemented, I don't want to be responsible for a bug with ordering Vine products.  Especially when items ordered via Vine can't always be cancelled like regular Amazon orders.  Instead, the category and page number will be displayed for specific items which you can then use to place orders normally through Amazon's website.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

Use at your own risk.  Understand that I will not be responsible for what happens to your Amazon Vine membership. While it is highly unlikely that Amazon will do anything to your account because of the simplicity of this application, don't assume that it is out of the picture.
